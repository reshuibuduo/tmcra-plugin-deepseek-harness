# TMCRA for DeepSeek Harness — Cross-App, Cross-Conversation Project Memory

Move between [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness), Codex, and other TMCRA-connected tools without explaining the project again.

This plugin connects Harness lifecycle events to the TMCRA Memory API. A new human prompt recalls account-global and current-project evidence in parallel, injects the resulting evidence into the model-visible session log, and writes the completed user/assistant turn back as two role-separated records.

The repository vendors the reviewable TypeScript client and lifecycle modules used by the adapter under `src/sdk/`. Hosted API, account, billing, control-plane, database, deployment, and production memory-engine code are not included.

> Status: technical preview. Verified with `@deepseek-ai/dsh` `0.1.1-rc.2` and TMCRA API `0.2.2`. DeepSeek Harness itself is currently a developer preview and may introduce breaking changes.

## Continue the same project across apps and conversations

TMCRA gives every account a global memory scope and every project an isolated project scope. When two supported tools use the same TMCRA account and resolve the same project identity, they read and update the same project memory. Work completed in Harness can therefore be recalled in a later Codex session, and progress written by Codex can be recalled after switching back to Harness.

Before the Agent answers, TMCRA retrieves the relevant user requirements, decisions, preferences, Agent progress, implementation results, tests, unresolved problems, and next steps. After the turn completes, the new human prompt and Agent result update the shared memory as separate role-labelled records with their source metadata preserved. Switching software or opening a new conversation no longer requires a fresh project introduction.

Cross-app continuity applies to memories that have reached TMCRA and requires both connectors to resolve the same project identity. TMCRA does not merge unrelated projects: `.tmcra/project.json`, Git identity, and the account-issued project-scope prefix keep project boundaries stable, while `session_id` remains provenance inside the project rather than a separate recall silo.

## What it does

- Continues one project across TMCRA-connected tools such as Codex and DeepSeek Harness.
- Recalls user-global and current-project memory before the first model request of each turn.
- Continues project work across separate Harness conversations.
- Keeps `session_id` as provenance inside a project scope; it does not create a third recall silo.
- Stores the human prompt and assistant result as distinct `user` and `assistant` records.
- Shares project memory across primary agents and subagents while preserving agent identity, role, parent session, and delegation depth in metadata.
- Derives a stable project scope from the Git origin, then the common Git directory, then the canonical workspace path.
- Redacts common API keys, bearer tokens, passwords, private keys, verification codes, and credential-bearing URLs before data crosses the TMCRA network boundary.
- Fails open on recall by default and keeps failed writeback in a crash-safe local outbox.

## Turn every project collaboration into knowledge you can keep using

The most valuable context in a long-running project is usually scattered across many conversations: why a requirement was chosen, which constraints shaped a design, what has already failed, where the implementation stopped, what the tests showed, and what should happen next. When a conversation ends, that context is easy to lose. Returning to the work often means explaining the project again, repeating investigations, or acting on conclusions that are no longer current.

With TMCRA connected, Harness records the goals, requirements, decisions, corrections, and working preferences expressed by the user. It also records the Agent's investigations, implementations, tests, diagnoses, and progress. User statements and Agent work remain distinct, so later conversations can tell the difference between a user decision, an Agent recommendation, and a result that was actually completed and verified.

As the project develops, those collaboration records are organized into:

- **Current project state:** goals, requirements, constraints, completed work, active problems, unfinished tasks, and suggested next steps;
- **Decision and implementation history:** why an approach was selected, important changes, experiments and test results, failed attempts, incident causes, and the solution that worked;
- **Reusable experience:** methods validated in real work, debugging paths, design principles, research notes, domain knowledge, and recurring pitfalls;
- **Personal working context:** explicitly stated preferences, habits, tools, collaboration patterns, and long-term interests.

This knowledge continues to change with the project. New conclusions update the current view while the earlier reasoning and history remain available. Separate projects stay separate, while conversations within the same project can share what has already been learned. At the start of a new conversation, the Agent can retrieve the project knowledge relevant to the current request before it answers or takes action.

Users can browse and search the memory library and knowledge graph in the TMCRA web or desktop app, return to the original conversation to verify an item, and delete memories that are incorrect, outdated, or no longer wanted. When local knowledge-base sync is enabled, stable project knowledge can also be organized into Obsidian for long-term personal use.

This is designed for development, research, product work, and multi-Agent collaboration that continues for weeks or months. It reduces repeated explanation, duplicated investigation, and repeated trial and error. Project progress can continue across conversations, and experience gained in one piece of work remains useful in the next.

## Requirements

- Node.js `22.19.0` or newer
- DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`
- `pnpm` on `PATH` for Harness plugin management
- A TMCRA account. The login command creates the scoped plugin token for you.

During the initial release period, TMCRA accounts are free to use with no memory-ingest or recall quota. Any later change to this policy will be announced in advance and will take effect only after user confirmation.

## Install the preview tarball

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/reshuibuduo/tmcra-plugin-deepseek-harness/releases/download/v0.1.4/dsh-tmcra-memory-0.1.4.tgz
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-tmcra-memory login
dsh --profile web --dump-config
dsh web
```

Harness serves its Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default.

The package contributes `cordis.patch.yml`, so the install command activates the plugin in the selected profile. Prefer the prebuilt release tarball. A locally downloaded copy can also be installed with `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-tmcra-memory-0.1.4.tgz`. Installing from a Git source may require an explicit `pnpm` build-script allowance.

DSH `0.1.1-rc.2` on Windows can still re-anchor a local package path incorrectly when the path contains spaces or non-ASCII characters. Copy the tarball to a short ASCII path first, such as `D:\\dsh-packages\\dsh-tmcra-memory-0.1.4.tgz`. The release URL above is not affected.

## Connect your TMCRA account

Run the login command after installation:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-tmcra-memory login
```

The command starts a PKCE-protected device authorization and opens `tmcra.com`. First-time users need to create a TMCRA account; existing users can sign in directly. Review the requested permissions and approve the displayed code. TMCRA then issues a restricted `memory:read` / `memory:write` token together with the account-global scope and project-scope prefix. The plugin stores those values in Harness's managed `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`; you do not copy an API key by hand.

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-tmcra-memory status
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-tmcra-memory logout
```

`status` reports whether the local Harness profile is connected without printing the token. `logout` removes only the TMCRA entries and preserves other Harness credentials. If the computer is lost or no longer trusted, revoke the connection from the TMCRA personal console as well.

Harness keeps credential values out of settings and model requests. A model-operated tool running as the same operating-system user may still read files that user can read, so the connection should remain tied to a trusted local account.

Default plugin configuration:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: tmcra-memory
      name: dsh-tmcra-memory
      config:
        baseUrl: https://api.tmcra.com
        baseUrlEnv: TMCRA_API_BASE_URL
        apiKeyEnv: TMCRA_API_KEY
        globalScopeEnv: TMCRA_GLOBAL_SCOPE
        projectScopePrefixEnv: TMCRA_PROJECT_SCOPE_PREFIX
        evidenceMode: auto
        recallFailureMode: continue
        waitForIngest: false
        recallTimeoutMs: 30000
        ingestTimeoutMs: 30000
```

`globalScope`, `projectScopePrefix`, and `projectScope` may be set explicitly for controlled deployments. Normal desktop use should keep automatic project derivation so different projects remain isolated while conversations inside the same project can continue one another. TMCRA uses the same `.tmcra/project.json` marker and Git-based scope formula as its Codex integration, allowing both tools to share one project memory graph.

## Lifecycle

```text
human prompt
  -> wait for prior project writeback
  -> reconcile the durable outbox
  -> recall global + project scopes
  -> append logged TMCRA evidence
  -> Harness model/tool loop
  -> successful turn end
  -> write USER and ASSISTANT separately
```

Recalled evidence uses Harness's durable plugin-message form (`form: recall`). It remains in the conversation until Harness compaction. TMCRA never rewrites or hides the local Harness transcript.

## Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:dsh-compat
npm run pack:check
pnpm audit --prod
```

The public unit suite validates lifecycle hooks, scope derivation, role separation, redaction, recall injection, and the durable outbox. The production-service contract harness remains private because it imports TMCRA control-plane modules; its acceptance result is documented below without publishing the service implementation.

The opt-in remote test uses a real TMCRA account token and creates two isolated Harness conversations:

```bash
TMCRA_REMOTE_API_KEY=... \
TMCRA_REMOTE_CLEANUP_API_KEY=... \
TMCRA_REMOTE_GLOBAL_SCOPE=... \
TMCRA_REMOTE_PROJECT_SCOPE_PREFIX=... \
npm run test:remote
```

It verifies writeback, job completion, a clean-session recall, and an empty durable outbox. `TMCRA_REMOTE_CLEANUP_API_KEY` is optional and is used only to delete the disposable test sessions; the normal plugin token remains limited to `memory:read` and `memory:write`. The test uses a recording answer adapter, so it validates the Harness/TMCRA lifecycle without external answer-model tokens or cost. TMCRA's own memory-processing model usage is still recorded separately by the service ledger.

On 2026-08-14, the preview passed a production API acceptance run: a new project wrote two completed turns as four role-separated memory records, and a second Harness conversation recalled both the user's checkpoint and the Agent's progress. The service ledger recorded two ingest events (53 estimated ingest tokens) and two recall requests under `deepseek_harness`: the first request targeted a brand-new scope and correctly failed open, while the second produced the effective cross-conversation recall. The memory-processing ledger recorded 7,894 model tokens with a known model API cost of CNY 0.00. Post-run cleanup deleted both disposable sessions and left zero related memory records, service messages, session rows, active base/delta index pointers, and foreign-key violations. The device connection, upstream scoped token, and local Harness credentials were all revoked or removed after verification.

## Current limits

- Account connection currently uses the guided CLI/browser flow; Harness does not yet expose a native TMCRA settings panel.
- It does not import historical Harness conversations.
- Long-session context growth follows Harness's durable recall-message and compaction semantics and still needs workload characterization.
- Compatibility is pinned and tested against Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`; DSH remains a fast-moving preview, so each new release requires a fresh compatibility run.
- The package has not yet been published to npm; the reviewed `.tgz` is the current installation artifact.
- A live DeepSeek-provider answer test requires the user's own DeepSeek credential; the memory lifecycle test itself does not require one.
- The memory library and knowledge graph are opened from the TMCRA web or desktop app; the Harness integration runs in the background during conversations.
